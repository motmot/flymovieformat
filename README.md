Fly movie format' (or .fmf) files are a simple, uncompressed video format for
storing data from digital video cameras. A fixed-size per frame means that
random access is extremely fast, and a variety of formats (e.g. MONO8, YUV422)
are supported.

This is a subpackage of the motmot family of digital image utilities.
